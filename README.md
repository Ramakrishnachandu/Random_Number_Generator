# Random_Number_Generator

#Introduction
There are various use cases for a Random Number Generator. You could do a random dice roll or get a random quote. Most of the time, the implementation is relatively straightforward and similar to this projectâ€™s approach. In this project, we will create a dice roll simulation.

#Requirements
The RNG should consist of:

An input box to assign how many dice to roll
A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
A PHP rand(); function taking the inputs from the form
An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6 ..), the total count of the dices rolled
Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop).

#Suggested Implementation
PHP is a server-side language, which means we need to use either a local web server (Free) or a web hosting package (Low cost) to run the code.
The majority of the functionality will be passed with PHP, HTML will allow us to create the form and the webpage structure, and CSS will give us the ability to style the HTML.Server: Local web server such as XAMPP or WAMP OR Web hosting
Basic PHP knowledge of using variables and POST content.
Using simple PHP functions such as rand();
Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to create forms


My entry for the **Random number generator web app** practice project on [*Codementor*](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/random-number-generator-web-app-bz042v8kll). It's a simple app that allows you to choose how many dice you would like to roll (1-5) and how many sides each die should have (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20).

Here the link to the app itself:
